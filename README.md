# r_for_eods

This is the GitHub repository related to the analysis of EOD ("Electric Organ Discharge") signals generated by Mormyridae (in Africa) and Gymnotoidei (in South Africa) fishes. This repository will host code written with R (and possibly MATLAB) within the framework of projects managed by Dr. Carl Hopkins (Cornell Universtity) and partner institutions (Royal Museum for Central Africa, University of Lubumbashi, SAIAB).
